# Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, also known as **PSQI**, subjectively assesses sleep quality in the last month.<br/>
It contains **19 questions covering 7 components:**

1. Subjective Quality of Sleep
2. Sleep Latency
3. Sleep Duration
4. Sleep Efficiency
5. Sleep Disorder
6. Use of Sleep Medication
7. Drowsiness and Daytime Dysfunction

**A result â‰¥ 5 indicates poor sleep quality!**

All the code was developed for my own study of the Python language, and to improve the application of this questionnaire to patients. <br/> 
But anyone can use it to discover the quality of their own sleep. **In case of a bad result, see your doctor!**
